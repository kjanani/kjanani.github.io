	DISCUSSION:
		Janani: all weeks

2) Class attendance (suggestion to all TAs):
	* I suggest you check out the first few classes (and especially the first one, on Tuesday March 29 at 3PM); after that, it's up to you: what matters is that you master the material so you can do the best possible job for the students; I'm not requiring class or discussion attendance and it does not count towards your time.
	* make sure to be up to date and slightly ahead of what I'm covering in class (you can go off the online class schedule and suggested readings in notes or book)

3) Personal tasks:

** a) Janani -- Head TA **

- Siavash interacts primarily with Janani; other TAs interact primarily with Janani

- students always email ecethirty@gmail.com for *everything*; all TAs will be given access to the email.  Head TA assigns the emails to specific TAs by placing them in a separate folder assigned to them (this folder will be in the gmail account itself).

ECE30 - PROJECT PLAN


1) Email:
	* All project emails: Siarhei
	* All other stuff: Janani (head TA) + other TAs

2) Week 2: Siarhei come into the lab sections 1 hr after the lab begins, to introduce the simulation tool and make the students do some basic stuff (for the last 2 hours).  Reminds kids to find partners.  If the students can't find partners, email ecethirty by end of week-2 (Apr 8).


3) Week 3: 
	* project description final
	* solution implemented and runs
	* email us who your partner is by end of week-3 (Apr 15)

4) week 4:  Sathya implements the solutions
	* all students linked to partners:
		- groups of two: they select their own partner; must be from the same lab section (Siarhei) can ask Janani for master grade sheet with all info)
		- students MUST email partner info to ecethirty@gmail.com by
		  Week 3.
		- if they cannot find a partner: they must email Siarhei by week 2.
		- Siarhei assigns partners by Friday of week-4 (Apr 22).  Those whom
		  you partner up, you need to email them to let them know
about who their partner is, and that they need to start working together.
		- no partner, or missing deadlines = lose points
	* project posted online

8) Week 5:
	- 8 - 8:50 AM: project presented in discussion section (Siarhei)

	- 3 project office hours (Siarhei) (same strategy as mentioned before)
